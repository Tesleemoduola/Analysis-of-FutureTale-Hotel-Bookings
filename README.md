## Project Overview
The FutureTale Hotel Reservation project using Excel aims to understand, address and mitigate the challenges posed by a significant increase in hotel reservation cancellation. 
By leveraging my skill in excel, the data unveiled, the hotel experienced a concerning trend - a 22% increase in cancellation rates during the period of July 2017 and October 
2018, casting a shadow over its once-stable reservation landscape. Not only this was unraveled but also understand the underlying factors that contributed to this significant 
shift in reservation dynamics.

## Problem Statement
- High number of cancellations and no-shows as a result of Current cancellation policy that allows free or low-cost cancellations.
- This policy benefits guests but negatively impacts the hotelâ€™s revenue.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide insights, conduct a comprehensive analysis of hotel reservation data with the aim of understanding and addressing specific 
challenges related to increased cancellation rates

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was provided by 10Alytics. The dataset contains Booking Id, no of adults, no of children, no of weekend nights, no of week nights, type of meal 
plan, required car parking space, room type reserved, lead time, arrival year, arrival month, month, arrival date, date, market segment type, repeated guest, no of previous cancelation, 
no of previous booking, booking status, avg price per room

## Data processing
In the process of handling the data, I engaged in compilation and cleansing activities. I systematically examined the dataset to identify and eliminate any duplicate entries. Additionally, 
I enhanced the dataset by introducing a new column labelled "sum of is_cancelled." Through the utilization of the "IF" function, I assigned the value "1" to indicate cancelled bookings 
and "0" for those that were not cancelled. Furthermore, I employed the VLOOKUP function to extract the corresponding arrival month names. This involved creating a table with an array containing 
month numbers paired with their respective names. By referencing this table, I successfully obtained the accurate arrival month names for the reservations at the FutureTale Hotel.

## Data Visualization

After I did data cleaning, I utilise Excel's functionalities for exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the reservation data. Visualized data distributions and 
relationships between variables using charts, graphs, and pivot tables. Calculated cancellation rates for different periods, market segments, meal plans, and room types using Excel formulas. I also 
Conduct detailed analyses of market segments, meal plans, and room types to understand their individual impact on cancellations. Used Excel to perform segmentation analysis and generate insights into 
the characteristics of high-cancellation segments. Also, Analysedd booking trends over time, especially between July 2017 and October 2018. Then, create time series charts to visualize the progression
of bookings, cancellations, and redemption rates. Develop strategic recommendations based on Excel-generated insights to address the identified challenges.
